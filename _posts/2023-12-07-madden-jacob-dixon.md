Around 7:30 in the morning on April 29th, 2014 Madden finished his battle with neuroblastoma. Mom and Dad were with him holding him and so was his Aunt Jen who was able to make it here just in time.

He is no longer suffering and looked as though he had a smile on his face. We are so sad and miss him very much but are glad that he is no longer suffering.

Thank you all so much for everything. This year has been a blessing because when we brought him in to CHCC he was dying and we got a chance to stop that process and got to get another year with him. As you all know it was a difficult year but also a very blessed year with multiple answered prayers and miracles. You all have truly demonstrated that no one fights alone and we are so thankful for all of your support and love, we couldnâ€™t have done this with out you!
